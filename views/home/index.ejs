      Hi! I'm Nick Rutowski, some people know me as Badsauce or Codesauce (most of those people are me).
   </p>

   <p>
      I'm a big fan of web design, I've dedicated a lot of time to creating enterprise websites using
      <a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc">
         ASP.NET MVC
      </a>.
      I've also spent some time getting paid to build sites using
      <a href="http://cakephp.org/">
         CakePHP
      </a>
      on the 
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)">
      LAMP
      </a>
      stack - Those were dark days, I try not to think about them. 
   </p>
   
   <p>
      In my free time I have messed around with a slew of other web technologies, on the MVC front I've dabbled in
      <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">
         Django
      </a>
      and recently started exploring the 
      <a href="http://nodejs.org/">
         Node.js
      </a>
      space with 
      <a href"http://sailsjs.org/#/">
         Sails.js
      </a>
      (This site is built on sails =O). On the subject of javascript, I've done some data visualization with
      <a href="http://d3js.org/">
         d3.js
      </a>
      and loved every minute of it.
   </p>

   <p>
     I write a lot of
     <a href="https://isocpp.org/">C++</a>
     and
     <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>
     for scholarly pursuits like http routing and learning how pointers work.
